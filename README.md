Checksums
This repository provides tools and scripts for generating and verifying checksums to ensure file integrity.

What is a checksum?
A checksum is a small-sized datum derived from a block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors. It's commonly used to verify that files have not been tampered with or corrupted.

How to generate a checksum
You can generate a checksum using various algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256.

Example using sha256sum (Linux/macOS)

bash
sha256sum filename.ext
Example using PowerShell (Windows)
Get-FileHash filename.ext -Algorithm SHA256

How to verify a checksum
To verify, compare the checksum you generate for the file with a known-good checksum value.

Example verification command (Linux)
bash
echo "expected-checksum  filename.ext" | sha256sum -c -

Example verification using PowerShell
Get-FileHash filename.ext -Algorithm SHA256 | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_.Hash -eq "expected-checksum") {
        Write-Output "Checksum OK"
    } else {
        Write-Output "Checksum does not match"
    }
}

Usage examples
Generate checksum:
bash
sha256sum myfile.zip > myfile.zip.sha256

Verify checksum:
sha256sum -c myfile.zip.sha256
